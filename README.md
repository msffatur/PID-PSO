# PID-PSO

This repository contain partial code of my final research in Engineering Physics ITB about Speed Control Design. This is an algorithm of PID tuner using basic Particle Swarm Optimization. Each particles of the swarm represent PID parameter of two controller (speed and position) consist of 2 Kp, 2 Ki, and 2 Kd. The optimal speed and position profile used as the input reference in the simulation. The objective function of the PSO is RMSE of speed and position with consideration by the constraint stated in the research.
